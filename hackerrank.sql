-- Weather Observation Station 5
--------------------------------
-- Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective
-- lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose
-- the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
-- Sample Input
-- Let's say that CITY only has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY
-- Sample Output
-- ABC 3
-- PQRS 4
-- Explanation
-- When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with the respective lengths  and . The longest-named city is obviously PQRS, but there are  options for shortest-named city; we choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.
-- Note
-- You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.

-- shortest city name
select city, char_length(city)
from station
order by char_length(city), city
limit 1;

-- longest city name
select city, char_length(city)
from station
order by char_length(city) desc, city
limit 1;

select distinct city
from station
where city RLIKE '^[aeiou]';
